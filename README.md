This program takes a file with a list of sold produce items and gets the frequency of items being sold. It then creates a file that lists the items and their frequency of being sold. The user chooses what they want to see from three options. They are displaying the frequency of a specific item, displaying the frequency of all items, and displaying a histogram of item frequency. To make this code more efficient, I could improve on the display functions to remove repetition. The most challenging part of this project was creating the histogram. I used stack overflow and the class textbook to figure it out. Skills that are transferable are writing OOP code, many popular languages like JAVA and Python are also OOP languages so knowing the principles of OOP will be useful. To make this code maintanable, readable, and adaptable, I wrote comments throughout the code and seperated functions from main().
